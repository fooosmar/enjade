<title>Mouse</title>

<para>This module allows you to configure your pointing device. Your
pointing device may be a mouse, a track ball, a touch-pad, or another piece
of hardware that performs a similar function.</para>

<para>This module is divided into several tabs:
<link linkend="mouse-general">General</link>,
<link linkend="mouse-advanced">Advanced</link> and
<link linkend="mouse-navigation">Mouse Navigation</link>.
</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Button Order</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>
If you are left-handed, you may
prefer to swap the functions of the <mousebutton>left</mousebutton> and
<mousebutton>right</mousebutton> buttons on your pointing device by choosing the
<quote>Left handed</quote> option. If your pointing device has more than two
buttons, only those that function as the <mousebutton>left</mousebutton> and
<mousebutton>right</mousebutton> buttons are affected. For example, if you have
a three-button mouse, the <mousebutton>middle</mousebutton> button is
unaffected.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Reverse scroll direction</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>
With this check box selected, the scroll wheel (if any) will work in the opposite direction (so that if rolling the top of the scroll wheel towards you previously causes a scroll down, then it will now cause a scroll up). This may be useful to handle a unusual setup of the X server.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Double-click to open files and folders (select icons on first click)</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para> If this option is not checked, icons/files will be opened with a
single click of the <mousebutton>left</mousebutton> mouse-button. This
default behavior is consistent with what you would expect when you click
links in most web browsers. If checked however, icons/files will be
opened with a double click, while a single click will only select the
icon or file. This is the behavior you may know from other desktops or
operating systems.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Single-click to open files and folders</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>This is the default setting. Clicking once on an icon
will open it.  To select you can drag around the icon(s) or <keycombo
action="simul">&Ctrl;<mousebutton>Right</mousebutton></keycombo> click,
or simply click and hold to drag it.</para>

<guilabel>Pointer acceleration</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>This option allows you to change the relationship
between the distance that the mouse pointer moves on the
screen and the relative movement of the physical device
itself (which may be a mouse, track-ball, or some other
pointing device.)</para>

<para>A high value for the acceleration multiplier will lead to large
movements of the mouse pointer on the screen, even when
you only make a small movement with the physical device.</para>

<tip><para>A multiplier between <guilabel>1x</guilabel> and
<guilabel>3x</guilabel> will works well for many systems.  With a multiplier
over <guilabel>3x</guilabel> the mouse pointer may become difficult to
control.</para></tip>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Pointer threshold</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>The threshold is the smallest distance that the mouse pointer must
move on the screen before acceleration has any effect. If the movement
is within the threshold, the mouse pointer moves as if the acceleration
were set to <guilabel>1x</guilabel>.</para>

<para>Thus, when you make small movements with the physical device (&eg;
mouse), you still have fine control of the mouse pointer on the screen,
whereas larger movements of the physical device will move the mouse
pointer rapidly to different areas on the screen.</para>

<para>You can set the threshold by entering a value into the edit box or
by clicking the up/down arrows to the right of the box.</para>

<tip><para>In general, the higher you set the <guilabel>Pointer
acceleration</guilabel> value, the higher you will want to set the
<guilabel>Pointer threshold</guilabel> value.  For example, a
<guilabel>Pointer threshold</guilabel> of 4 pixels may
be appropriate for a <guilabel>Pointer Acceleration</guilabel> of
2x, but 10 pixels might be
better for 3x.</para></tip>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Double click interval</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>This is the maximum amount of time between clicks to
register a double click.  If you click twice, and the time between those
two clicks is less than this number, that is recognized as a double
click.  If the time between these two clicks is greater than this
number, it is recognized as two <emphasis>separate</emphasis>
single clicks.</para>

<title>Mouse Navigation</title>

<para>
This tab allows you to configure the keyboard number pad keys as a mouse-type device. This may be useful when you are working on a device without another pointing device, or where you have no other use for the number pad.
</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Move pointer with keyboard (using the num pad)</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>
To enable keyboard mouse mode, you need to select the check box labeled <guilabel>Move pointer with keyboard (using the num pad)</guilabel>. When you do this, the other settings will become enabled, and you can customize the keyboard pointer behavior further, if required.
</para>
<para>
The various keys on the number pad move in the direction you would expect. Note that you can move diagonally as well as up, down, left and right.  The <keycap>5</keycap> key emulates a click to a pointer button, typically &LMB;. You change which button is emulated by using the <keycap>/</keycap> key (which makes it &LMB;), <keycap>*</keycap> key (which makes it &MMB;) and <keycap>-</keycap> (which makes it &RMB;). Using the <keycap>+</keycap> emulates a double click to the selected pointer button. You can use the <keycap>0</keycap> key to emulate holding down the selected pointer button (for easy dragging), and then use the <keycap>.</keycap> to emulate releasing the selected pointer button.
